//! A platform agnostic driver to interface the [`HC-SR04`][2] (ultrasonic distance sensor).
//!
//! This driver is built using [`embedded-hal`][1] traits.
//!
//! # Usage
//! Currently the sensor is implemented with interrupts in mind. This allows
//! us to accurately measure the pulse width, but at the cost of needing
//! external support for calling `HcSr04::update`.
//!
//! See the `examples` folder for further information.
